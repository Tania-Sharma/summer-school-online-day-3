        <h2>About My Internship</h2>
        <p>
          I am really excited to share that I got selected for a summer internship with 
          <a href="https://www.iitjammu.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Jammu</a> in collaboration with 
          <a href="https://techible.in/" target="_blank">Techible</a>. I applied through the official 
          <a href="https://summerschool.iitjammu.ac.in/" target="_blank">Summer School</a> website. There were many domains like Python, AI, and IoT, but I chose Web Development because I wanted to build my basics strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I didn’t know much before this, but now I feel confident to learn step by step. I believe starting with basics is really important for any beginner.

        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Since long, I have been curious about how websites work and look so clean and interactive. I wanted to learn how everything shows up when we click buttons or fill forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel web development is beginner-friendly too. I can see results quickly on my screen — which keeps me motivated. Someday, I want to build my own personal website completely by myself!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="learning">
        <h2>Learning So Far</h2>
        <p>
          We started with HTML basics — how to write headings, paragraphs, links, images. It felt so good to see my name and my first web page open in the browser! After that, we did CSS — styling, colors, spacing, layouts. Now, we have started with JavaScript and learned how to add simple interactivity.
          Our mentor, Nitin Raina Sir, explains everything in an easy way.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="tasks">
        <h2>Hands-On Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          After every class, we get small assignments. My first task was to make a simple portfolio page using HTML. The second was designing a profile card with HTML & CSS. The third one is this blog — where I’m using CSS Grid and sticky layout for the first time!
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing these tasks makes me more confident. I also Google solutions and watch short videos when I get stuck — and that’s helping me learn faster.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sessions">
        <h2>Orientation & Extra Sessions</h2>
        <p>
          Before the classes began, we had an orientation session where mentors explained how everything will work. We were also guided on writing LinkedIn posts and why it’s important to share our progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          We even got an extra module about AI tools — which was something new for me. It opened my mind to how AI can help students and developers both!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="masterclasses">
        <h2>Sunday Masterclasses</h2>
        <p>
          Every Sunday, there is a special masterclass with an industry expert. So far, we have learnt about how to build a strong resume, tips for interviews, and why DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is important. These sessions are very motivating and give us an idea about real industry expectations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="next">
        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>
          I am excited for the upcoming classes and new projects. There is still a lot more to learn — React, Node, MongoDB — all are waiting for us! I hope to make the most of this internship and build a strong base for my future projects.
